A small library app: add\remove books.
Live:https://artemyosovskoi.github.io/Library/
# Overview
Library project aims to show new js skills, especially working with objects.
# Problem
Build an app where user can add new books with title, author etc. Then user can remove those books, as well as mark them with different statuses (reading\not read\will read).
# Status
Started 21.10.23
Finished 15.11.23
# Conclusion
This was an interesting project, especially since I love reading. 
I learned: 
- how to use constructor functions and prototypes
- how to implement forms
- how to manipulate arrays
- more css grid practice
- 19.03.24: how to use Classes. Code was refactored from constructors to Classes.

ToDo:
- add local storage
